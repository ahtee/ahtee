# Hello 👋

I am a Software Developer who is interested in `["the JavaScript ecosystem", "Native cloud", "CICD", "application stack automation", "serverless infrastructure"]`. Primarily experienced in `Javascript`, `node.js`, `react` and `aws`, but curious about similar technologies.

```js
let enjoyableHobbies = ["playing video games at home or in arcades", "attending sports games or watch parties", "going to local concerts", "enjoying weather rain or shine", "learning German"]
```
